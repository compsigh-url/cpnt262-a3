## Hints
This app gets an object for a random item from the The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API.

The way they organzed these items is sequential, 
"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/[objectID]"

Sadly, many items are missing so fetching from them returns a 404 error. In this case I've made the page display an item missing message.
